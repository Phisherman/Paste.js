Welcome to Paste.js!
====================
Paste is an slim web application to allow you to create fast texts (notices, lists, minutes...) and share them with a link.

Paste.js uses Font awesome(http://fontawesome.io/), jQuery (http://jquery.com/), and Angular.js (http://angularjs.org/) 

Installation
============
If you have an mysql server, you can use it to store the pad data. Open the file Core/datalayer.php and enter your user credentials at the line with "$connect = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "")"".

After that, you have to create the database. You can do that for example by selecting dump.sql out of phpMyAdmin (or equivalent)
